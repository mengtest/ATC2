Aww That's Cube II, my second Unity project, is game that exudes a retro video game feel in a 3-D environment. The player is a cube whose main mission is to eliminate all other enemy cubes. It is the sequel to Aww That's Cube I. The development period was between July 16 to August 14, 2020. The genre is action/top-down, third-person arcade shooter.
